    <abstract>
      <para>Dissolved inorganic nutrients are measured from water column bottle
samples taken on NES-LTER Transect cruises (ongoing since 2017) and
include nitrate + nitrite, ammonium, silicate, and phosphate. Sampling
frequency is approximately seasonal. Samples were filtered, frozen, then
processed at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Nutrient
Analytical Facility. Each sample may have up to 2 replicates, indicated
by a or b in the data table. These macro-nutrients are analyzed in
seawater using a colorimetric assay in which light absorbance is
measured versus known standards, and final concentrations are calculated
in micromole per liter. Some of the data are from cruises in collaboration with the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI).

          <markdown>Three projects NES-LTER, Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), and MIT-WHOI Joint Program (JP) provide dissolved inorganic nutrient data from CTD rosette bottle and bucket sampling on NES-LTER Transect cruises. Methods are the same across the thre projects.

From 2017 through 2022, spring and fall sample collection typically occurred on cruises funded and operated by the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). These cruises are identified with the project_id OOI, and they include data collected for both the NES-LTER and OOI projects. Please note that OOI data are included here as a convenience to researchers wishing to use the data from both projects, and that the authoritative source for OOI data is the OOI Alfresco document server for Cruise Data from the Coastal Pioneer NES Array (https://alfresco.oceanobservatories.org/).

 MIT-WHOI Joint Program (JP) cruises (AR22, AR32, and AR38) are funded by WHOI Academic Programs Office.

# CTD Rosette Bottle and Bucket Sampling on NES-LTER cruises

Samples were collected from the water column at multiple depths using
Niskin bottles on a CTD rosette system. Some samples were collected at
the surface with a bucket.

# Nutrient Filtering Protocol

Prior to 2018, and for bucket samples: Wearing nitrile gloves, collect
water from the niskin or bucket with a clean bottle that is rinsed 3
times with the sample water. Rinse the full length of a B-D 60 ml
LUER-LOKTM syringe with a small volume of sample water 3 times.
Completely fill syringe with sample water and force 60 ml through a EMD
Millipore sterile Sterivex 0.22 um filter. Then refill the syringe.

2018 to present: Wearing nitrile gloves, connect AcroPak 200 Capsule
with Super Membrane 0.2 um filter with barb and tubing to niskin spigot
and fill with water. Rinse filter with 3 times the volume of the filter.
Then refill the filter.

All samples: Then, without touching filter to sample vial (acid-washed
scintillation vial 20 ml), rinse sample vial with 5 ml of filtered water
3 times. For each rinse, replace the cap and shake vigorously. Filter 17
ml of sample directly into the sample vial and replace the cap and
proceed to the next sample. Store samples in a -20 deg C freezer and
keep frozen until analysis. If applicable, flush AcroPak filter with
milli-Q water and refrigerate for using on next cast (AcroPak filter may
process up to 20 liters).

# WHOI Nutrient Facility Nutrient Analysis

Samples are stored at -20 deg C until submitted to the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution's Nutrient Analytical Facility
(https://web.whoi.edu/nutrient/) which operates a four-channel segmented
flow SEAL AA3 HR Autoanalyzer. Duplicates and spiked additions are run
for quality control. Standards are made daily and Certified Reference
material is run daily to ensure the standards and/or reagents are good.
If the samples fall outside of the duplicate or spike addition quality
control they are rerun until they fall within quality control
parameters. Precision is 1e-03 microMolePerLiter. Please refer to the
Facility's website for current detection limits which are different
depending on the nutrient.

# Nutrient Data Cleaning

The data table was made by concatenating cruises called from the REST
API of the NES-LTER data system. All Below Detection Limit values are
set to zero. Nearest station is based on a cruise-specific station list.
NES-LTER standard stations L1 to L13 are the same for cruises starting
with EN617 in August 2018. Prior to this: the NES-LTER transect was
established on the present longitude 70.8833 W on EN608; however, the
position for standard station L5 was 1 naut. mile north of present
station L5. The station list for EN608 was used for cruises prior to
EN608. Data assembly, cleaning, and metadata template assembly were
performed in R Markdown. Additional nutrients data for Ocean
Observatories Initiative (OOI) cruises on R/V Neil Armstrong are
available from the OOI Alfresco document server (Coastal Pioneer Array
\&gt; Cruise Data \&gt; select a cruise \&gt; Ship Data \&gt; Water Sampling).
Further documentation can be found on GitHub, at
https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-nutrient-transect.

# Quality Assurance

We assured that the geographic and temporal coverage of the clean data
table were within expected ranges. No values changed as compared to the
previous version of this data package. For each nutrient we checked
differences between replicates, visually inspected plotted values, and
performed a range check.

For published version 3, preliminary quality flags were assigned to the data. Automated code was used each nutrient type individually to check for differences between replicates. Quality is indicated in the data table with IODE Primary Level flags: 1 good; 2 not evaluated, not available or unknown; 3 questionable/suspect; 4 bad; 9 missing data. [See IODE Ocean Data Standards recommendation here: https://www.iode.org/index.php?option=com_oe&amp;task=viewDocumentRecord&amp;docID=10762] Thresholds for flag 3 and 4 were set for each nutrient type, and if poor replication was above a threshold, both nutrients received the same flag. It is posseble one replicate is good and future versions of the package will include manual checking to assess the automated flagging and apply appropriate flagging quality control. Due to the preliminary nature of the current flagging scheme, no data have been removed from the data set at this time. Future manually checked versions of flagging will possibly replace values with NA.

      <abstract>
        <para>The Northeast U.S. Shelf (NES) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project integrates observations, experiments, and models to understand and predict how planktonic food webs are changing, and how those changes impact the productivity of higher trophic levels. The NES-LTER is co-located with the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem, spanning the Middle Atlantic Bight and Gulf of Maine. Our focal cross-shelf transect extends about 150 km southward from Martha’s Vineyard, MA, to just beyond the shelf break. Our overarching question is: How is climate change impacting the pelagic NES ecosystem and, in particular, affecting the relationship between compositional (e.g., species diversity and size structure) and aggregate (e.g., rates of primary production, and transfer of energy to important forage fish species) variability?</para>
