## Creating a Data Package for NES-LTER Nutrient Transect Cruise Data

This repository contains the workflow used to prepare the NES-LTER nutrient transect cruise data and assemble an XML metadata file for publication to the Environmental Data Initiative. This data collection is ongoing since 2017.

This workflow includes the following:
1) compiles cruise data from the [NES-LTER REST API](https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-ims/wiki/Using-REST-API) and supplies useful fields for the end user
2) cleans the provided data
3) performs quality assurance on the data
4) assembles and outputs the final XML file for submission to EDI

### Package Status:
Version 2 of this data package is published to the EDI repository [here](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-nes&identifier=4&revision=2).
