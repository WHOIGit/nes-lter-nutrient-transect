Dissolved inorganic nutrients are measured from water column bottle samples taken on NES-LTER Transect cruises (ongoing since 2017) and include nitrate + nitrite, ammonium, silicate, and phosphate. This version of the data package is specific to NES-LTER Transect cruises on R/V Endeavor; sampling frequency is approximately 6 months (summer and winter).  Samples were filtered, frozen, then processed at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institutionâ€™s Nutrient Analytical Facility. Each sample may have up to 3 replicates, indicated by a, b, or c in the data table. These macro-nutrients are analyzed in seawater using a colorimetric assay in which light absorbance is measured versus known standards, and final concentrations are calculated in micromole per liter.
