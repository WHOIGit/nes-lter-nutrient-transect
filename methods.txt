# CTD and Rosette Bottle Sampling on NES-LTER cruises

Samples were collected from the water column at multiple depths using Niskin bottles on a CTD-rosette system.

# Nutrient Filtering Protocol

Wearing nitrile gloves, connect filter (AcroPak 200 Capsule with Super Membrane 0.2 um) with barb and tubing to Niskin spigot and fill with water. Rinse/flush filter with 3 times the volume of the filter. Then, without touching filter to sample vial (acid-washed scintillation vial 20mL), triple rinse sample vial and take sample (rinse vial and cap 3 times, then fill ~17 ml directly into the sample vial). Store samples in a -20 deg C freezer and keep frozen until analysis. If applicable, flush filter with milli-Q water and dry air for using on next cast (filter may process up to 20 liters).

# WHOI Nutrient Facility Nutrient Analysis

Samples are stored at -20 deg C until submitted to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Nutrient Analytical Facility (https://web.whoi.edu/nutrient/) which operates a four-channel segmented flow SEAL AA3 HR Autoanalyzer. Duplicates and spiked additions are run for quality control. Standards are made daily and Certified Reference material is run daily to ensure the standards and/or reagents are good. If the samples fall outside of the duplicate or spike addition quality control they are rerun until they fall within quality control parameters. Precision is 1e-03 microMolePerLiter. Please refer to the Facility's website for current detection limits which are different depending on the nutrient.

# Nutrient Data Cleaning

The data table was made by concatenating cruises called from the REST API of the NES-LTER data system. All Below Detection Limit values are set to zero. Nearest station is based on a cruise-specific station list. NES-LTER standard stations L1 to L13 are the same for cruises starting with EN617 in August 2018. Prior to this: On AR22 and AR24 the NES-LTER transect was on longitude 70.83 W (to the east of present transect). AR22 LTER stations 1, 2, 3 corresponded to AR24 LTER stations 1, 3, 5. On EN608 the NES-LTER transect was established on the present longitude 70.8833 W with standard stations L1 to L13; however, on EN608 and AR28 the position for standard station L5 was at a different latitude (1 naut. mile north of present station).The data cleaning and metadata template assembly was performed in R Markdown.

# Quality Assurance

We assured that the geographic and temporal coverage of the clean data table were within expected ranges. For each nutrient we checked differences between replicates, visually inspected plotted values, and performed a range check.
