# CTD Rosette Bottle and Bucket Sampling on NES-LTER cruises

Samples were collected from the water column at multiple depths using Niskin bottles on a CTD rosette system. Some samples were collected at the surface with a bucket.

# Nutrient Filtering Protocol

Prior to 2018, and for bucket samples: Wearing nitrile gloves, collect water from the niskin or bucket with a clean bottle that is rinsed 3 times with the sample water. Rinse the full length of a B-D 60 ml LUER-LOKTM syringe with a small volume of sample water 3 times. Completely fill syringe with sample water and force 60 ml through a EMD Millipore sterile Sterivex 0.22 um filter. Then refill the syringe.

2018 to present: Wearing nitrile gloves, connect AcroPak 200 Capsule with Super Membrane 0.2 um filter with barb and tubing to niskin spigot and fill with water. Rinse filter with 3 times the volume of the filter. Then refill the filter.

All samples: Then, without touching filter to sample vial (acid-washed scintillation vial 20 ml), rinse sample vial with 5 ml of filtered water 3 times. For each rinse, replace the cap and shake vigorously. Filter 17 ml of sample directly into the sample vial and replace the cap and proceed to the next sample. Store samples in a -20 deg C freezer and keep frozen until analysis. If applicable, flush AcroPak filter with milli-Q water and air dry for using on next cast (AcroPak filter may process up to 20 liters).

# WHOI Nutrient Facility Nutrient Analysis

Samples are stored at -20 deg C until submitted to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Nutrient Analytical Facility (https://web.whoi.edu/nutrient/) which operates a four-channel segmented flow SEAL AA3 HR Autoanalyzer. Duplicates and spiked additions are run for quality control. Standards are made daily and Certified Reference material is run daily to ensure the standards and/or reagents are good. If the samples fall outside of the duplicate or spike addition quality control they are rerun until they fall within quality control parameters. Precision is 1e-03 microMolePerLiter. Please refer to the Facility's website for current detection limits which are different depending on the nutrient.

# Nutrient Data Cleaning

The data table was made by concatenating cruises called from the REST API of the NES-LTER data system. All Below Detection Limit values are set to zero. Nearest station is based on a cruise-specific station list. NES-LTER standard stations L1 to L13 are the same for cruises starting with EN617 in August 2018. Prior to this: On AR22 and AR24 the NES-LTER transect was on longitude 70.83 W (to the east of present transect). AR22 Joint Program (JP) stations 1, 2, 3 correspond to AR24 LTER stations 1, 3, 5. On EN608 the NES-LTER transect was established on the present longitude 70.8833 W with standard stations L1 to L13; however, on EN608 and AR28 the position for standard station L5 was at a different latitude (1 naut. mile north of present station). Data assembly was performed using Jupyter Notebook with Python, and data cleaning and metadata template assembly were performed in R Markdown.

# Quality Assurance

We assured that the geographic and temporal coverage of the clean data table were within expected ranges. For each nutrient we checked differences between replicates, visually inspected plotted values, and performed a range check.
