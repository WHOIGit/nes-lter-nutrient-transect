# CTD and Rosette Bottle and Bucket Sampling on NES-LTER cruises

Samples were collected from the water column at multiple depths using Niskin bottles on a CTD-rosette system. Samples were collected at the surface (depth = 0) with a bucket.

# Nutrient Filtering Protocol

We will replace much of the text quoted from an old protocol with text from the current Nutrient_Sampling_Protocol.docx in Sosik_protocols. The following is paraphrased from the WHOI Nutrient Facility Cruise Protocol for Filtering Nutrient Samples, version 23 April 2007. Fill a B-D 60 ml LUER-LOKTM syringe with approximately 10mls of water and partially insert plunger.  Shake vigorously to cleanse the inside of the syringe and discard water.  Repeat three times. Completely fill syringe with sample. Insert the plunger and remove any air in the syringe.  Attach a EMD Millipore sterile Sterivex (0.22um) filter to the syringe.  Advance the plunger and force 60mls of water through the filter to rinse the filter of any previous sample. Rinse the filter with a full syringe each time a new sample is introduced to the syringe. After cleaning the filter, refill the syringe and rinse the sample vial 3 times with 5mls of filtered water. For each rinse, replace the cap and shake vigorously. Filter 17 ml of sample directly into the sample vial and replace the cap and proceed to the next sample. Immediately store samples in a -20C freezer and keep frozen until analysis.

# WHOI Nutrient Facility Nutrient Analysis

Samples are stored at -20 deg C until submitted to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Nutrient Analytical Facility, https://web.whoi.edu/nutrient/. As of 2013, the facility operates a four-channel segmented flow SEAL AA3 HR Autoanalyzer. Duplicates and spiked additions are run for quality control. Standards are made daily and Certified Reference material is run daily to ensure the standards and/or reagents are good. If the samples fall outside of the duplicate or spike addition quality control they are rerun until they fall within quality control parameters. Precision is 1e-03 microMolePerLiter. All Below Detection Limit values are set to zero. The detection limit is different depending on the nutrient, and the detection limit has gotten lower over the time series with improving technology. Please refer to the Facility's website for current detection limits.


# Nutrient Data Processing

The data table was made by concatenating cruises called from the REST API of the NES-LTER data system. The data cleaning and metadata template assembly was performed in R Markdown. Further documentation can be found on GitHub, at https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-fish-diet-isotope.

# Quality Assurance

We assured that the geographic and temporal coverage of the clean data table were within expected ranges.
