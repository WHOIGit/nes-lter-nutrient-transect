Dissolved inorganic nutrients are measured from water column bottle
samples taken on NES-LTER Transect cruises (ongoing since 2017) and
include nitrate + nitrite, ammonium, silicate, and phosphate. Sampling
frequency is approximately seasonal. Samples were filtered, frozen, then
processed at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Nutrient
Analytical Facility. Each sample may have up to 2 replicates, indicated
by a or b in the data table. These macro-nutrients are analyzed in
seawater using a colorimetric assay in which light absorbance is
measured versus known standards, and final concentrations are calculated
in micromole per liter.
